  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
This HTTP API enables a web application to initiate payment for a product or
service by responding with an HTTP 402 Payment Required response and
enough data to initiate and complete a payment flow. The
implementation of this feature is expected to be implemented by any HTTP
server and client that is interested in executing payments.
  </p>
  <section class="informative">
    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

    <p>This document is a detailed specification for a HyperText Transfer Protocol
      application programming interface (HTTP API) for executing payments via
      an HTTP client and server. The document is primarily intended for the following
      audiences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software developers who want to understand the design decisions and
        algorithms behind the API.</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to implement the API.</li>

  <h2>Payment Flow Overview</h2>

  <p>
The diagram below outlines a basic HTTP client payment flow with no errors.
The basic flow starts out with the <a>payer</a> accessing a protected resource.
The <a>payee</a> provides a location where a payment request for the resource
can be fetched. The <a>payer</a> fetches the payment request, selects
a payment app, and sends the request and the selected app
on to the appropriate <a>payment service provider</a> for processing. The
<a>payment service provider</a> initiates the payment and sends a
payment request acknowledgement back to the <a>payer</a>. The <a>payer</a>
then forwards the payment request acknowledgement back to the
<a>payee</a>. If there are no errors, the <a>payee</a> then grants access to
the resource that was purchased.
  </p>

  <p class="issue">
The flow below reflects a fairly advanced tokenized payment scenario. We may
want to use a simpler basic credit card flow where the customer doesn't have
a payment service provider and just returns the credit card details to the
merchant.
  </p>

  <script type='text/jumly+sequence'>
@found "Payment Service Provider (customer)"
@found "Payer client (customer)", ->
  @message "access resource", "Payee server (merchant)", ->
    @reply "402 Payment Required", "Payer client (customer)"
@found "Payer client (customer)", ->
  @message "GET payment request", "Payee server (merchant)", ->
    @reply "payment request", "Payer client (customer)"
@found "Payer client (customer)", ->
  @message "POST payment request", "Payment Service Provider (customer)", ->
    @reply "payment request acknowledgement", "Payer client (customer)"
@found "Payer client (customer)", ->
  @message "POST payment request acknowledgement", "Payee server (merchant)", ->
    @message "verification", ->
      @reply "grant access to resource", "Payer client (customer)"
  </script>

  <p class="issue">
It may be a good idea to return the payment request with the 402 response.
The concern is that this would be a misrepresentation of the resource. The
counter-argument is that a client shouldn't interpret a 402 response as
the resource, and since 402 has not been formally defined yet, we could
define it to always come with a payment request response.
  </p>

  <ol class="algorithm">
    <li>
The <a>payee</a>'s web page requests payment by responding with a 402 Payment Required
response code and a URL encoded in the <code>Location</code> header
to fetch the <code>request</code> from.
    </li>
    <li>
The payment agent fetches the <code>request</code> from the URL specified
in the <code>Location</code> header in the previous step.
    </li>
    <li>
The payment agent scans the list of previously registered <a>payment app</a>s
and finds matches against <code>acceptedMethods</code> in the
payment request.
    </li>
    <li>
A <a>payment app</a> is selected by the payment agent or the <a>payer</a>. The
process MAY consist of one or more of the following steps:
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
If there is only one app that matches, that is automatically set
to the <em>selected <a>payment app</a></em>.
        </li>
        <li>
If there is a pre-existing preference set by the <a>payer</a> that narrows the
selection of the <a>payment app</a> to one match, the match is set to the
<em>selected <a>payment app</a></em>.
        </li>
        <li>
If there is more than one potential match, the <a>payer</a> is asked which
app they would like to use and the selection is set to the
<em>selected <a>payment app</a></em>
        </li>
        <li>
If there are no matches, the <a>payer</a> is notified and may be taken to an
alternate flow where a matching <a>payment app</a> is acquired.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
If the <a>payment app</a> does not require the payment flow to switch
to a 3rd party payment processor (e.g. cryptocurrency),
then the payment acknowledgement is generated locally and the
payee's software is notified.
    </li>
    <li>
If the app requires the payment flow to switch to a 3rd party
payer payment processor (e.g. push-payment like a PayPal/Google
Wallet-like app, ACH, ISO20022 style app):
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
The payment agent forwards the <code>request</code>, and
<em>selected <a>payment app</a></em> via an HTTP POST to the
<code>paymentRequestService</code> in the <a>payment app</a> for approval.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
If the app requires the payment flow to switch to a 3rd party
payee payment processor (e.g. pull-payment like non-EMV magstripe credit
card with embossed PAN and CVV2, or tokenized credit card):
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
The payment agent forwards the request on via an HTTP POST
to the <code>paymentRequestService</code> in the
<code>acceptedMethod</code> (note that the <a>payee</a>
sets this, not the <a>payment app</a>).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
The payment flow is then transferred to the entity that is going to
generate the <em>payment acknowledgment</em> (locally installed
payment app, <a>payee</a>'s payment service provider, or <a>payer</a>'s
payment service provider).
    </li>
    <li>
Once the entity in control of the payment flow finalizes the
<em>payment acknowledgement</em>, even if the message is to
acknowledge that the payment failed, the <em>payment acknowledgement</em>
is generated and the <a>payer</a>'s payment agent is notified via an HTTP 200
success code.
  </ol>
  <p class="issue">
Melvin Carvalho has also raised an issue noting that we may not want to use
402 and the Location header, but rather an additional HTTP header called
<code>Payment</code> that is compatible with multiple 4xx error conditions.
  </p>

The diagram below outlines the basic payment flow described above for a
push-based payment.

  <section>
    <h3>Payment app Registration</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The <a>payer</a>'s HTTP client navigates to a payment service provider website
and authenticates itself to fetch a <a>payment app</a> to register:
        <pre class="example" title="Authenticated GET of <a>payment app</a>">
GET /apps/visa HTTP/1.1
Host: mybank.example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2017 20:51:35 GMT
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Digest username="jdoe", realm="jane@mybank.example.org", ...
        </pre>
        <div class="issue">
While digest authentication is used above, more advanced authentication
schemes may also be employed. For example, the mechanism below uses
HTTP Signatures and public/private key cryptography to authenticate the client
with the server:
        <pre class="example" title="Authenticated GET of <a>payment app</a> using HTTP Signatures">
GET /apps/visa HTTP/1.1
Host: mybank.example.org

      </li>
      <li>
The payment service provider MUST respond with the <a>payment app</a> or
an HTTP error code. If successful, something like the following will be
returned:
        <pre class="example" title="Successful retrieval of <a>payment app</a>">

    <h3>Processing a Payment Request</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>

Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2017 21:31:35 GMT
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
The <a>payee</a> server notifies the <a>payer</a> that a payment is required along with a
payment request.

    <h3>Processing a Payment Acknowledgement</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The payment service provider receives a payment request, authenticates
the <a>payer</a>, and proceeds with the payment:
      <pre class="example" title="Example of a payment request">
POST /services/cards/2745023475 HTTP/1.1
Host: mybank.example.org

}
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
The payment service provider generates a payment acknowledgement
message, which is a [[!JSON-LD]] object that contains enough information to
verify that the transaction has completed in success or failure:
        <pre class="example" title="Example of a payment acknowledgement">

        </pre>

      <li>
The <a>payee</a> validates the payment acknowledgement, sets the appropriate
access control for the resource, and re-directs the <a>payer</a> to the
resource:

    <h2>Message Extensibility</h2>

    <p class="issue">
One proposal for providing message extensibility is to allow messages to
be interpreted as JSON-LD with a specific context, such as
<code>https://example.org/contexts/web-payments/v1</code>. Doing this would
not only solve message versioning, but it would also enable
decentralized extensibility for all payment messages while ensuring that
there are no clashes in terminology between industry verticals.
