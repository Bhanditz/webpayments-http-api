          Background to Publication as a Note
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Web Payments Working Group first published this document as a
          <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-webpayments-http-api-20160915/">Working
          Draft</a> in September 2016. At the time, the Working Group had
          already focused on in-browser payments for a year and projected that
          its browser focus would continue through the bulk of its <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/charter-201510.html">(initial)
          charter</a>. The Working Group made a decision to publish this
          document (along with <a href=
          "https://w3c.github.io/webpayments-http-messages/">Web Payments HTTP
          Messages 1.0</a>) to socialize it more visibly, and potentially to
          align it with <a href=
          "https://w3c.github.io/payment-request/">Payment Request API</a> as
          it matured.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the Working Group neared the end of its initial charter, the group
          discussed whether to continue to list out-of-browser payments as in
          scope in its second charter. Participants at the Working Group's
          <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/2017/11/06-wpwg-minutes.html#item07">face-to-face
          meeting in November 2017</a> expressed consensus to publish this
          document as a group Note rather than advance it to Recommendation,
          but to maintain discussion of message structure in charter scope.
        </p>
        <p>
          This document was published by the <a href=
